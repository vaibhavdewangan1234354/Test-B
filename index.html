    <h1>Happy Birthday Baby</h1>
    <p>Dear Bishakha,</p>
    <p>Happy birthday to the coolest girl I know! It's hard to believe we're already in 9th grade, but I'm so glad we're doing it together. You're smart, funny, and beautiful, and I feel lucky to call you my girlfriend.</p>
    <p>I hope this year is everything you want it to be and more. May you have great grades, fun times with friends, and new adventures that make lasting memories. And may you always know how much you mean to me.</p>
    <p>You're more than just my girlfriend - you're my best friend, my confidante, and my partner in crime. You make me laugh when I'm sad, and you support me when I need it most. You're the reason I look forward to going to school every day, and I'm grateful for every moment we spend together.</p>
    <p>On this special day, I want to celebrate you and all that you are. You are kind, compassionate, and always true to yourself, and I admire you more than words can say. Happy birthday, my love! Let's make this year our best one yet.</p>
    <p>I Love You Baby</p>
